# Learning to code repository

The purpose of this repository is to introduce fundamental concepts to coding with clear instructions and examples. 

Similar to bootcamps format this will assign you with simple tasks to complete along the way up to more complex tasks as you become more familiar with each module.

There is no particular order in which you should approach these modules however you may find that some more advanced modules will require you to have some pre-requisite knowledge.(These will be listed to the best of my ability)


### Suggested Order Of Learning:
- Command Line
- Understanding the browser
- Javascript basics
- Introduction to IDE
