## Introduction to command line basics

### Navigating the terminal

Upon opening the terminal you will find yourself at the users home folder - delineated by a ```~``` in your prompt.

To list the files and folders in the directory you are currently in use the command:

```ls```

To list all files and folders including hidden files:

```ls -a```

Lets navigate into a folder then back to home as a practice.
The command you need to change directory is:

```cd```

Using this by iteself will yield no results as the terminal
does not know where you would like to change directory to,
lets choose one of the folders from your list you called earlier.
Try executing the command:

```cd Downloads```

You should see that the prompt now says ```~/Downloads```

This shows you have moved into a new folder. If you run ```ls``` again you will be able to see the files listed in your Downloads folder.
